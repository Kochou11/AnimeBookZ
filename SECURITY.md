# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At AnimeBookZ, we take security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report it to us by sending an email to animebookz31@gmail.com. We will respond to you as soon as possible.

## Response Plan

Once we receive a report, we will do the following:

- Confirm the issue and determine its scope and impact

- Prioritize the issue based on severity

- Assign the issue to a member of the security team for resolution

- Notify the reporter of our plan of action and expected timeline for resolution

- Resolve the issue as quickly as possible

- Release a patch for any confirmed issues

- Issue a security advisory to all affected users and the wider community

## Disclosure Policy

We believe in responsible disclosure and will work with reporters to understand and address any issues as quickly as possible. We ask that reporters give us reasonable time to investigate and address any issues before making them public.

We will acknowledge all reporters who submit valid reports and, if desired, will include their name and affiliation in the security advisory. If you wish to remain anonymous, please let us know in your report.

## Scope

This policy applies to all repositories owned by AnimeBookZ.
